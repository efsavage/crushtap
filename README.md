CrushTap
==================

CrushTap is a Raspberry Pi-based hardware and software project that will let you monitor environmental conditions remotely via any web browser, including a mobile device.  Following these step-by-step instructions should get you up and running with no real electronics or software development background.  This is very much a DIY project so you will need some patience!

## What You'll Need

 - A Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, this will likely work with other models with little or no modification, but that is the reference for these instructions.

 - An HDMI-compatible display and a USB keyboard and mouse.  You will only need to perform the initial configuration of your Raspberry Pi. 
 - One or more DS18B20 Temperature Sensors, the waterproof style is recommended. 
 - A 4.7kÎ© Resistor, 0.25W

## Raspberry Pi Setup

 - Run startx and get online by Wi-Fi[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/] or Ethernet.
 - Run raspi-config and enable SSH.
 - Install node
 
## CrushTap Setup
